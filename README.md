# Retro Arcade

## Overview

Retro Arcade is a virtual arcade-style web app where users can play classic retro games and compete against each other. Currently, the only game in scope is **Pong**, but additional games may be added depending on project scope.

This application is built for students and workers who need a quick break between classes or meetings. With short modern attention spans, we want to create a pick-up-and-put-down experience that delivers simple, low-effort fun while still providing a competitive edge. Leaderboards, friendly challenges, tournaments, and ranking systems help keep those two spare minutes engaging.

As developers, we’re excited to build an interactive online game that encourages quick bursts of fun and competition. This project also gives us the opportunity to learn new technologies such as game/state management and real-time interactivity using websockets.
